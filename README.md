## What is this?

[Scrabbletown](http://timpaul.github.com/scrabbletown/) is a tile game written in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. It's similar to another popular tile-based word game, but with roads instead of letters.

It's also [a real place](http://eccentricroadside.blogspot.co.uk/2009/08/lost-for-words-greetings-from.html).

## How do I play?

Help the residents of Scrabbletown develop their plot of land by laying down roads for them. 
You and your opponent score points depending on the value of the road tiles you place on the board.
Tiles with more roads or bigger roads score more points.

Remember though; you can only place tiles next to other tiles if their road colours match up.
All the tiles you play in a turn must be next to each other.
You can rotate tiles by clicking on them.

If you lay roads through a commercial zone (grey square) your tile value is doubled.
However, if you lay roads through a parkland zone (green square) the tile value is taken off of your score.

When the last tile has been played the winner is the person with the most points.

## Why have you done this?

I got a bit obsessed with map tiles last year during a week's holiday in a caravan near the Welsh border (blame a lack of internet access). It all ended badly...

I think the idea has been bouncing around in my head ever since.

## How can I help?

Lots of ways. Fork away. All pull requests welcome. I'm especially interested in how the rules and parameters of the game could be improved - board size, number of tiles, rules around tile placement etc.

Thanks
